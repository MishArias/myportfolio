          Prior to my transition into the tech industry, I worked as a correctional officer, where I honed my skills in problem-solving, discipline, and maintaining a calm and composed demeanor in high-pressure situations. This experience taught me the importance of effective communication, adaptability, and the ability to work well within a team. Before that, I spent several years in the restaurant industry, where I gained valuable skills such as customer service, time management, and experience in a fast-paced environment. These experiences have shaped me into a professional who can thrive in dynamic environments.
